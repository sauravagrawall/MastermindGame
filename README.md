# Mastermind_Game
This is an arcade game created using data structures.

First, the program will randomly allocate a secret sequence of 4 colors in the memory. Now according to the difficulty level, the user gets some constant chances to guess the correct sequence. In each iteration user will enter a sequence of colors, trying to match with the original sequence created by the program. Each time the user enters a sequence, program matches it with the original sequence and gives the output according to the rules. 
If any color is right in the sequence but the position is different then the computer gives the output as “white”. And, when the color and position, both are in the correct place, program gives the output as “black”. Lastly the program will declare the user winner if he gets four “black” in the output or loser if he is not able to. After that user gets an option which is implemented through switch case that if he wishes to continue to another game or wants to end it. 
The players should be able to enter four colors as their guess. When they enter their guess, then your program should display their guess and next to the guess it should display the score.
